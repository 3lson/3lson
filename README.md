## Highlight Projects

- [**Hardware-accelerated ITCH market data processor**](https://github.com/3lson/TickandTradeFPGA)
Hardware-accelerated processing of ITCH market data feeds using SystemVerilog. This project implements a full RTL pipeline to parse UDP packets and calculate a Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicator with nanosecond-level latency.

- [**HADESRedDragonC_Compiler**](https://github.com/3lson/HADESRedDragonC_Compiler)  
  A **C90-to-RISC-V compiler** built from scratch for an instruction architecture and compilers module. Covers IR generation, register allocation, and backend emission.

- [**RISC-V**](https://github.com/3lson/RISC-V-Team2)  
  Full implementation of a **5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU** in SystemVerilog, including hazard detection, stalling, and forwarding.

- [**World's Hardest Game FPGA Multiplayer**](https://github.com/3lson/FPGA_whg)  
  A real-time multiplayer remake of The World's Hardest Game, where players use a **DE10-Lite FPGA** board (tilt-controlled via accelerometer) to move in-game. Features a hardware-accelerated FIR filter, a hybrid **TCP/UDP** networking stack, and a cloud backend **(Go server + AWS DynamoDB)** with persistent high scores.

- [**Hardware-Accelerated Mandelbrot Explorer**](https://github.com/3lson/Mandelbrot_FPGA)
  Engineered a real-time Mandelbrot Set explorer by designing a parallel computation engine in **SystemVerilog**, creating a full-stack hardware/software co-design on a Zynq-7000 SoC. This hardware accelerator achieved an 82x performance speed-up over the CPU, with its parameters controlled dynamically through an interactive web UI built with Python and Flask.

- [**FPGA_Runner**](https://github.com/3lson/FPGA_Runner)  
  Unity-based endless runner game **controlled using an FPGA accelerometer**. Real-time TCP communication links embedded input to 3D game movement.

- [**InfoProcLabs**](https://github.com/3lson/InfoProcLabs)  
  Embedded systems coursework focused on **sensor integration, communication protocols, and cloud databases** using FPGA and AWS.
